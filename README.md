## ML_library_implementations
#This Repository is created for implementing Machine Learning Algorithms such as Multiple Linear Regression, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression along with necessary data processing functions such as Standard Scaler and Encodings such as One and Hot and Label encoding.
#The only libraries used for achieving this will be numpy and pandas. 
#The functions will be usable in a similar manner to the Scikit learn modules but won't be as flexible as it (such as the DF only standard scaler)
